I often ask my partner random questions and she’ll ask me the same in return. Many of these were spontaneous and I didn’t know the answers to my questions myself until I had to respond to them. Yesterday, while watching the sunset together from the windows of our bedroom, the question was, “what is a perfect life to you?”

I contemplated about it a while. This is a paraphrase of what I said to her:

> My perfect life…it would be to feel alive every day, if not every moment. Aliveness, is the capacity to notice the beauty and preciousness of the mundane. For example, till today I still think [_bak chor mee_](https://rubbisheatrubbishgrow.com/2015/08/04/best-bak-chor-mee-in-singapore/) is one of the best dishes in the world even though it is like SGD $3 and it seems such a simple dish. It is to notice I do not have a migraine right now at this moment and how amazing it is to have a painless, clear and free mind. It is to be able to appreciate the value of something even though you can experience it everyday. 

Once in a while I’ll have a string of days that appear to be some cosmic conspiracy. A couple of days ago I watched [NADI Singapura](https://www.facebook.com/nadisingapura/) perform at [Ground-up Initiative](https://www.facebook.com/groundupinitiative/). I experienced an almost inarticulable, profound moment. Tears started to well up and I suddenly felt clarity about the person I am. I thought at that moment: everything I have done, am doing and will do, is just to accommodate the simple desire to see my fellow human beings express aliveness – just like how the NADI ensemble was playing their percussion instruments in perfect harmony. I wish I could describe their faces when they were performing. There was so much joy, they were just so _alive_.

In life, everything we do is mixed up with hidden motivations, personal egos and societal conditioning, but despite all of that once in a while if we’re lucky, we are able to feel a certain _truth_ that is so simple, resounding and undeniable.

I don’t know if I’ll carry this simple truth with me for the rest of my life, if it’ll change. All I know is that such _lucidity_ and _coherence_ for me is still rare, and I cherish these moments when I am in close encounter with my own existence juxtaposed with the universe (The rest of the time I just live in existential despair).

We capped the weekend watching [“Into the Wild”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)) and the [first episode of Chef’s Table Season 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Wild_(film)) about a Korean Buddhist nun who is also an amazing chef. All in, it was a rare weekend spent in conscious contemplation and consumption. 

Sometimes, I think life is worth living just to experience the aliveness of the world, whether it is expressed through art, someone’s way of life, work; or the magical wonder of witnessing nature being alive just by being what they are.
